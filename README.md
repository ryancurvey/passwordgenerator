## Ryan Password Generator

* This project was created to help the user create randomized passwords with upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters.

* The user can select the length of the password between 8-128 characters. The app will not advance if the user chooses outside of this range, and require them to select a number in the range.

* The user will then have the ability to choose which character types they would like included in their new password.

* Once all options are chosen the password will be displayed on the new password box.

* That page can be found at this address: https://ryancurvey.github.io/passwordgenerator/

* Here is a Screenshot of the completed page:
